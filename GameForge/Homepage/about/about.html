        <h1>About GameForge</h1>
        <p>
            Welcome to <strong>GameForge</strong>, a platform built by a begginer college student named Gurjot. As an newbie web developer, 
            I created GameForge to help gamers discover and explore a wide range of exciting titles. 
            However, please note that **I do not own or sell any of the games featured here**. My website simply redirects users to the original game platforms 
            such as Steam, Epic Games, and others, where the games can be purchased or downloaded.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>
            The mission of GameForge is simple: **to connect gamers with the best games available online**. 
            I aim to provide an easy-to-navigate platform where users can explore top-rated games and then quickly find the correct official platform to download them.
        </p>
